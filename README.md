# ManicomioShareCouchPotatoPlugin
Plugin for couchpotato to search manicomio-share for files. 
To install, clone the repo to your custom_plugins folder and after restarting couchpotato enable it in the settings.


## Know problems

1.  Some torrents in the tracker have wrong dates in the search panel. This makes couchpotato 'think' the torrent is wrong and it will ignore the file. This will not be fixed;
2.	For brazillian movies, choose the brazillian name in couchpotato;
3.	Various methods of validation were implemented, but results may vary.
